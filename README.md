# Google Homepage
This is a Monochrome version of the Google Homepage. 
This is the first project in [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/home) HTML/CSS beginner tutorial. 
I recreated it to look and feel as much like the Google homepage (while using Safari) as possible.
I really focused on the search bar and getting the caret to fill the full size of the search bar, be fully centered and have the text a user inputs be centered through the searchbar. I also made the logo a background image, as Google's homepage also does the same, as opposed to a regular image which is what I originally intended to do. 
I have not added any hover effects to any buttons, as the project guidelines specified not to do so.
