This is a Monochrome version of the Google Homepage. 
I decided to recreate the Google Homepage in Monochrome as I love the simplicity of black and white (with a bit of grey). 

I chose to build the Google Homepage as it is the first project in The Odin Project's HTML/CSS beginner tutorials. 
I recreated it to look and feel as much like the Google homepage as possible, and decided to restart the CSS a few times when
I worked out cleaner ways of coding (although I'm sure it could still be much cleaner!).

I played around with this project for a full day trying to get everything laid out as closely to the "original" as possible. 
I learnt a lot of new methods whilst creating this, and really understood the concept of 'build, build, build'. 

This project can be viewed easily at - https://theskywasgreen.github.io/google-homepage/
