This is a Monochrome version of the Google Homepage. 
I decided to recreate the Google Homepage in Monochrome as I love the simplicity of black and white (with a bit of grey). 

I chose to build the Google Homepage as it is the first project in The Odin Project's HTML/CSS beginner tutorials. 
I recreated it to look and feel as much like the Google homepage as possible, and decided to restart the CSS a few times when
I worked out cleaner ways of coding (although I'm sure it could still be much cleaner!).

I played around with this project for a full day trying to get everything laid out as closely to the "original" as possible. 
I really focused on the search bar and getting the caret to fill the full size of the search bar, be fully centered and have the text a user inputs be centered through the searchbar. I also made the logo a background image, as Google's homepage also does the same, as opposed to a regular image which is what I originally intended to do. 
I have not added any hover effects to any buttons, as the project guidelines specified not to do so. 
I learnt a lot of new methods whilst creating this, and really understood the concept of 'build, build, build'.
